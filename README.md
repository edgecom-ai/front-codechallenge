# Frond End Developer - Code Challenge

As a front-end developer, you must do a code challenge. You have 3 options:

- Do task 1 (Article Management System).
- OR do task 2 (Data Table Component).

Depending on your choice and the result we evaluate your expertise and seniority.

## Task 1

Develop a dashboard to manage articles with these rules:

- There is no API. You have to mock the API in a separate layer in the code. So, we can replace it with a real API without touching other parts of your code.
- The edit page and Delete confirmation dialog need to be included.
- Remember, these are just wireframes to show you the requirements and boundaries of work, but the design is totally up to you.
- You must check user mistakes on filling in forms (like email address, required fields, etc.).
- Protected pages should not be available for guest users.
- Wysiwyg editor is not required.
- Tags field is a combobox which you can select some tags or use custom tags.

## Task 2

Write a data table component with these features:

- Support TypeScript.
- Support pagination.
- Support page size.
- Support simple search (so we can just type a query and filter rows).
- Support column customization.
- Support sort fields.
- Support dark mode.
- Write some examples to show your component’s features.

## General Requirements

- Use ReactJS
- Write necessary tests, but not with high coverage.
- Remove all unused codes if you use a boilerplate or framework.
- Write an instruction to run the project.
- All pages and components should be responsive.
- Do anything else that can impress us, but don’t overwork.
- You should use a linter like PrettierJS or any others.
- Don’t commit the .vscode or .idea directory.
- Mention the required NodeJS version
  
### Deliverables for the Code Challenge
- Code and Documentation: Include all code and documentation necessary to reproduce the experiments and results.
  
### Submission
- Please submit a GitHub link with your work and fork the repository for collaboration.
- You have 1 week to send the challenge!
